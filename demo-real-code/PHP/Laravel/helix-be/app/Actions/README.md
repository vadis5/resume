# What is Actions?

This is a place for additional logic that can't be placed in the Models, Controllers etc to avoid "fat models", "fat
controllers".

This is place for business logic that couldn't be placed in well-known Laravel code patterns from the point of view of the
best practice.

# Naming rules

We use "Action" as suffix.
<actionName><Action>
